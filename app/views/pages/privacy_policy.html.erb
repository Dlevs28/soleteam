Thank you for registering at www.HiOscar.com. At Oscar, it is our policy to protect your information. We know that we have a lot of information about you and want to be sure that we use it the right way.
Collecting and using personal information?

When you enrolled in one of our plans, you (or the State depending on how you enrolled) provided us with some information about you. From your enrollment, we know your name, address, social security number and more. When you activate your account or register on our website, much of the information that we collected from you (or the State) will be used. Don’t worry – only you can see this information. Each member is assigned a unique username to access their account information through www.HiOscar.com - only you should use your user name and the password you choose to log into your account. Do not give this user name and password to others. Oscar also maintains data that has been provided to us or uploaded to Oscar by you, our member, as well as our Business Associates (those vendors who perform work on our behalf for the purpose of payment, treatment, or healthcare operations - and who have written agreements with us that specifically indicate how they will protect your information). We maintain claims information, information about prior authorizations that you requested and any other information needed to provide you with the healthcare services that you need. In some cases, we may request additional consent from you if we think that there is other information that will help us better coordinate your care or better personalize it towards your needs.

If you have provided your contact information to us, we may use that information to contact you for marketing and promotional purposes by various means, including regular mail, email or telephone. You may receive messages about wellness programs or other programs sponsored by Oscar or its Business Associates. If we receive your express consent, we may also send you pre-recorded messages or SMS text messages. We may also use your information to notify you about payment information and/or to communicate with you about your account.

In some cases, you will be able to update the information that you provide to us by going to the settings page at HiOscar.com; in other cases, you may need to contact the State to update your information. Oscar will not sell, license, transmit or disclose this information outside of Oscar unless (a) expressly authorized by you, (b) necessary to enable our Business Associates to perform certain functions for us, or (c) required or permitted by law. In all cases, we will disclose the information consistent with applicable laws and regulations and we will require the recipient to protect the information and use it only for the purpose it was provided. Oscar takes HIPAA seriously and provides appropriate safeguards to your personal health information (PHI) – this incudes your name, address, social security number, e-mail address, telephone number and claims data.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. For more information about our privacy practices, including what information is provided to our Business Associates for payment, treatment and healthcare operations, please see our Notice of Privacy Practices.

Our site and services are not intended to be used by children under 18 years old. You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age. If you are under age 18, you may not use the site or services. We do not knowingly collect personal information from, or target our site or services to, children under the age 18. We understand that there may be exceptions to this rule including, but not limited to children who are emancipated. If we discover that the site is being used inappropriately, we will disable the user ID so that the individual may no longer access our site.

We will share your comments and questions with our customer service representatives and those employees most capable of addressing your questions and concerns. Please note that your e-mail, like all non-encrypted Internet e-mail communications, may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us.

Other information; "cookies" and "tags"?

You should also be aware that when you visit our websites, we collect certain information that does not identify you personally, but provides us with "usage data," such as the number of visitors we receive or what pages are visited most often. This data helps us to analyze and improve the usefulness of the information we provide at these websites. Like most commercial website owners, we may use what is known as "cookie" technology. A "cookie" is an element of data that a website can send to your browser when you link to that website. It is not a computer program and has no ability to read data residing on your computer or instruct it to perform any step or function. By assigning a unique data element to each visitor, the website is able to recognize repeat users, track usage patterns and better serve you when you return to that site. The cookie does not extract other personal information about you, such as your name or address. We may also use what is known as "client-side page tagging", which uses code on each page to write certain information about the page and the visitor to a log when a page is rendered by your web browser. This technique is also commonly used on commercial websites. "Tagging" does result in a JavaScript program running on your computer, but it is limited to providing information about the page that you are requesting and the configuration of your browser. It will not read any of your data files, or execute any additional programs. It does not extract any personal information about you, such as your name or address. You can prevent tagging by disabling JavaScript in your browser, but that may prevent you from using all of our website's functions.
Linking to other sites?

From time to time, Oscar may provide links to other websites that we think might be useful or interesting – these are not owned or controlled by Oscar and may be subject to separate terms and conditions and privacy policies. While we try to be proactive and ensure that appropriate protections are in place, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices used by other website owners or the content or accuracy of those other websites. Links to various non-Oscar websites do not constitute or imply endorsement by Oscar of these websites, any products or services described on these sites, or of any other material contained in them.
Security?

Oscar has adopted and adheres to stringent security standards designed to protect non-public personal information at HiOscar.com against accidental or unauthorized access or disclosure. Among the safeguards that Oscar has developed for this site are administrative, physical and technical barriers that together form a protective firewall around the information stored at this site. We are committed to being HIPAA compliant and ensuring that our Business Associates meet the same standards. We periodically subject our site to simulated intrusion tests and have developed comprehensive disaster recovery plans. We also review Business Associates privacy and security policies on a regular basis.
Changes to this statement?

Oscar may change this statement from time to time; when updates are made, the privacy policy version date will also be updated to reflect that a revision occurred. We encourage you to periodically reread this policy to see if there have been any changes that may affect you. A user is bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses the site or services after such changes have been first posted. This statement is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
